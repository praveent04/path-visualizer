# path-visualizer

pathFinderVisualizer I have created a Path Finder Visualizer using js. This interactive tool showcases various pathfinding algorithms,including BFS, Dijkstra's Algorithm and Greedy Best-first Search allowing users to experiment with custom mazes and witness algorithms in action. speed of visualizer and pixels are also controllable. will add some tutorials on it later :)
